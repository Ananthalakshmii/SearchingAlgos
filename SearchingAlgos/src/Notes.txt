TWO types of search operation:
1. Sequential search eg:Linear search
2. Interval search: searching in sorted data structures. eg: Binary search

SEARCHING ALGORITHMS:
1.Linear Search
2.Binary Search
3.Jump Search
4.Interpolation Search
5.Exponential Search
6.Sublist Search (Search a linked list in another list)
7.Fibonacci Search
8.The Ubiquitous Binary Search
9.Recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array
10.Recursive function to do substring search
11.Unbounded Binary Search Example (Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time)
